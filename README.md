# Text-Detection-with-Tello

The idea behind this project is to enable Tello DJI drone to consider actions according to the detected text in the live video that could be streamed over a UDP port. However, in TextDetection_Tello.py file I consider 3 main actions when their detected. "TAKEOFF", "LAND" and "ROTATE360".
